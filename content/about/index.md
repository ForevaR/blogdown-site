Hey, I'm Matt - a 28-year-old M.Sc. student currently residing in Ontario, Canada. Outside of research you can find me learning R, reading, exercising, outdoors, gaming (e.g., OSRS, board games) or listening to music (e.g., Darkest Hour, In Flames). After completing my M.Sc. I have my eyes set on joining the military for a few years and then consulting in the environmental field. I've always had an internal fire to embark upon an uncommon societal arc while also being a part of something meaningful in the world. So far, it has been a relatively easy road; now, I'm purposely trying to make it more difficult. I have become somewhat obsessed with seeing where that mentality leads.
