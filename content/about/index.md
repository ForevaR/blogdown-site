Hey, I'm Matt - a 28 year old M.Sc. student in Ontario, Canada. Outside of research you can find me learning R, reading, exercising, outdoors, gaming (e.g., OSRS, board games) or listening to music (e.g., Darkest Hour, In Flames). After completing my M.Sc., I have my eyes set on joining the military for a few years and consulting in the environmental field afterward. I've always had an internal fire to do some meaningful in the world with my time. It has been a pretty seamless road thus far, so I am purposely trying to make it hard; maximising one's potential follows that path and I'm curious to see where it leads.
