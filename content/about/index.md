#### Hey!
I'm Matt - a 28 year old M.Sc. student currently residing in Ontario, Canada. Outside of research you can find me learning R, reading, exercising, outdoors, gaming (e.g., OSRS, board games) or listening to music (e.g., Darkest Hour, In Flames). After completing my M.Sc., I have my eyes set on joining the military for a few years and consulting in the environmental field afterward. 

I've always had an internal fire to embark upon an uncommon societal arc and be a part of something meaningful in the world. Thus far, It has been a pretty seamless road, so I purposely try to make it hard. I'm somewhat obsessed with seeing where that leads.
